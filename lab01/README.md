* Lab 01 - Hello world from JRuby

By the end of this lab, you should be comfortable running Ruby scripts
in JRuby, as well as verifying the Ruby runtime version you're
executing code in, and switching between 1.8 and 1.9 modes.

Step 1: Make sure you have Java installed
$ java -version

Step 2: Make sure you have JRuby installed
$ jruby -v

Step 3: Run hello.rb
$ jruby -S hello.rb

Step 4: Run hello.rb in 1.9 mode
$ jruby --1.9 -S hello.rb

* Lab 05: Convert a Rails app

Enclosed is a very simple rails app.  Feel free to bring your own for
this lab.  Install jruby-lint and run jrlint from the chosen rails
app's root folder.

Many of the suggestions may be simple edits to the Gemfile.  Scoping
existing, incompatible gems dependencies to :platform => :ruby, and
adding their preferred jruby counterparts scoped to :platform => :jruby.
